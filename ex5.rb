# STUDY DRILLS

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1 - Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

# 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2 - Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby.
