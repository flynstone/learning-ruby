# STUDY DRILLS

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1 - Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.

# done

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2 - Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and, using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.

#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3 - Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.

# 

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4 - Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
